# Welcome to my project page!

<b><a href="https://master.d19gsti4yiutb.amplifyapp.com">Current state</a></b>: The page now has a functioning account system. Users can sign-in and create accounts. They can also sign in, make changes on the main page, sign out, and log-in again with their previous state saved. I am currently designing the main page where users will use the image recognition tool.

This is a personal endeavor. I am interested in cloud computing and AI. So, I have taken on a personal project that combines these interests of mine in a seemingly simple manner. Hopefully, by the end of this project I have ...
<ol>
  <li>Improved my full-stack development skills with React</li>
  <li>Gained valuable experience with AWS</li>
</ol>
  
I do not know much about AWS nor am I very familiar with full-stack. This project will begin with a lot of learning and planning before I actually begin development. I am excited for what I will learn during this project! Hopefully this opens up some exciting new avenues for me.
