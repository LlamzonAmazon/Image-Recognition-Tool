# AIImageRecognitionTool
An AI-powered image recognition tool implemented with Amazon Web Services.

This is a personal endeavor. I am interested in cloud computing and AI. So, I am going to undertake a personal project that combines these two interests of mine in a seemingly simple manner. Hopefully, by the end of this project I have ...

<ol>
  <li>Improved my full-stack development skills</li>
  <li>Gained valuable experience with AWS</li>
  <li>Learned how to integrate AI into an application</li>
</ol>
  
I do not know much about AWS nor am I very familiar with full-stack. This project will begin with a lot of learning and planning before I actually begin development. These are two things I have been meaning to gain experience with. So, I am excited for what I will learn during this project.
